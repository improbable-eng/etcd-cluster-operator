# This service is to give the pods persistent network identity, and must have the same name as the cluster. This is
# because the `spec.clusterName` field on the EtcdPeer resources below is used to set the `spec.subdomain` field on the
# resulting pods. As this service is headless, pods with a subdomain that matches the name of this service will get
# their own DNS name.
#
# This service is *also* used for client access. Because the API for etcd is gRPC, load balancing is done on the client
# side. In addition, etcd provides a advertised client URL, which will just be the persistent network identity that
# this service creates.
#
# Therefore, using this service the etcd cluster can be communicated with by a pod in the same namespace like this:
#
#     etcdctl --endpoints "http://my-cluster:2379" member list
