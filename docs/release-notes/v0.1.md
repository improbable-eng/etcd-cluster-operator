# Release v0.1

## Changelog for [v0.1.0](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/releases/v0.1.0) - 2019-11-13

### Notable changes

* [#5](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issues/5) **EtcdPeer resource controller**

   An MVP implementation of the EtcdPeer controller now exists. 
   This controller allows users to create `EtcdPeer` resources, and will [create pods](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/16) running `etcd` in response.
   This controller handles the [bootstrap](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/18) process, using etcd's static bootstrap method.

* [#23](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issues/23) **EtcdCluster resource controller**

   A etcd cluster controller has also been added.
   This controller allows users to create `EtcdCluster` resources, and will [create `EtcdPeer` resources](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/27) in response.
   It also [creates a headless service](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/24) for client and peer access to the cluster.
   The membership status of the etcd cluster will be [posted](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/58) to the `EtcdCluster` resource status. 

* [#29](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issues/29) **Persisted data for etcd clusters**

   Etcd clusters can have their data be persisted between cluster restarts.
   The EtcdPeer controller will [create a PVC](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/46) for each `EtcdPeer`.
   This PVC is used to store etcd data, and persists between updates to the peer or cluster resoures.

* [#39](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issues/39) **Default and validating webhooks**

   All current resource types (`EtcdPeer` and `EtcdCluster`) now have [defaulting and validating webhooks](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issues/39) deployed.
   These webhooks allow resources to hold defaults which are applied before the resource is stored, as well as perform pre-apply validation in addition to the OpenAPI validation done by default.
